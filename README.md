# Promethium
3D GH Noteskin for OutFox

-----

*Promethium*, A name chosen because it's a heavy metal, but also in reference to the story of Promethius. A story about how man's inginuity can create great things, but also create great pain and suffering. This noteskin is an example of brute-forcing an idea to fruition, and as such it showcases what is possible for a noteskin, but also showcases what probably should not be done. This noteskin certainly is "heavy" at nearly 10MB, several times larger than almost any other noteskin I've seen.

As a bit of a promise for the future, this noteskin will serve as the basis for a newer, more streamlined noteskin that I hope to donate to the OutFox project. *Paladium* will be the successor to look for!
